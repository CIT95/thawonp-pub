One thing I hope we create with our dev work is honestly just learning fundamentals to go off and possibly get certified and obtain a job within the field to utilize coding. It'd be interesting and fun to create a website, and I'm hoping we learn how to! Even encrypting codes to secure them and protect them from non-authorized users would be super interesting and useful. So far everything we've been learning has been fun seeing the results after trying and attempting basic codes, and I can't wait to see what else we learn throughout the course!
